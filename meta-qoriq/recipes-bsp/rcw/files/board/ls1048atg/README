The RCW directories names for the LS1088ARDB  boards conform to the following
naming convention:

abcdefghij_k_l_mn:

a = What is available in SFP cage 1
b = 10G copper Port available
c = QSGMII available
d = QSGMII available
e = QSGMII available
f = QSGMII available
g = QSGMII available
h = QSGMII available
i = QSGMII available
j = QSGMII available
K = What is available in SerDes 2
l = SATA2

For the Slots (c..j):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'S' is SGMII
 'Q' is QSGMII
 'F' is XFI
 'C' is 10G copper
 'H' is SATA

Serdes1 protocol (m):
m = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (n):
n = 'hex value of serdes2 protocol value'

BIN   Core/Platform/DDR
Bin1: 1800MHz/700MHz/1866MT/s

Ref clock setting on board
==========================
DDR Ref clock: 100MHz
Sys PLL Ref clock:100MHz

Files naming convention
=============================
PBL_q_r_s_o_p.bin

o = SerDes1 Protocol
p = SerDes2 Protocol
q = Core frequency
r = Platform frequency
s = DDR frequency

For example,
	PBL_1800_700_2100_0x1d_0x0d.bin

Errata Workaround Implemented
=============================
A-009102:
	Default SERDES setting may cause excess errors in SATA controller
	Workaround: Write 0x502880 to LNmSSCR1 register for every lane
		before enabling SATA operation.Using PBI commands
		write 0x802880 to 0x01eb099c
		write 0x802880 to 0x01eb09dc

A-010554:
	SATA controller may fail to detect some hard drives
	Workaround: Before enabling SATA controller
		write 0x80104e20 to 0x1eb1300
		write 0x80104e20 to 0x1eb1310

A-000009:
	SATA Gen3 speed (6Gbps) exhibit high error rate
	Workaround: Before enabling SATA controller
		write 0x00502880 to 0x1eb099c
		write 0x00502880 to 0x1eb09dc
