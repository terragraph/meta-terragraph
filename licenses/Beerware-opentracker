The beerware license is very open, close to public domain, but insists on honoring the original author by just not claiming that the code is yours. Instead assume that someone writing Open Source Software in the domain you’re obviously interested in would be a nice match for having a beer with.

So, just keep the name and contact details intact and if you ever meet the author in person, just have an appropriate brand of sparkling beverage choice together. The conversation will be worth the time for both of you.
